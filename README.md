# Threat-Informed-Deception-Technology (TIDT)
Mapping with MITRE ATT&CK for Deception Technology

**Project Overview**
This project establishes a mapping of deception technologies to Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) within the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Motivation**
Traditional security controls often struggle to fully defend against modern attacker tactics. Deception technologies offer a valuable addition to a layered security strategy, misdirecting attackers and wasting their resources.

**Project Goals**
Develop a comprehensive list of deception technologies relevant to cybersecurity.
Map these technologies to specific TTPs identified within the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
Provide details on how each deception technology can be employed to counter specific TTPs.
Create a publicly available resource for security professionals to understand deception's role in their defense strategy.

**Target Audience**
Security professionals and analysts responsible for network defense
Security architects designing and implementing layered security controls
Red Team operators seeking to understand potential deception techniques employed by defenders

**Project Deliverables**
A publicly accessible spreadsheet (or similar format) mapping deception technologies to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs. This spreadsheet will include columns for:
TTP ID
TTP Description
Potential Deception Technologies
Notes (implementation details, limitations, etc.)
A comprehensive README file documenting the project's purpose, methodology, and how to utilize the mapping resource.

**Project Benefits**
Provides a valuable reference for security professionals to explore deception's role in defense.
Improves understanding of attacker TTPs and how to counter them with deception strategies.
Contributes to the knowledge base of deception technologies within the cybersecurity community.

**Next Steps**
Refine the list of deception technologies through further research.
Populate the mapping spreadsheet with TTPs from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, starting with a specific category (e.g., Reconnaissance).
Document the project with a comprehensive README file.
Host the project repository on GitHub for public access and collaboration.

**Disclaimer**
Deception technologies are a complex and evolving field. This project provides a starting point for understanding how deception can be used in conjunction with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The effectiveness of deception will depend on the specific situation and attacker techniques employed.
